                <p>
                  Ok so here's a tool I've had in the works for some years now
                  which I hope will be useful to the web developers amongst you.
                  It's primarily designed for development, as the name should
                  imply, and allows for rapid development and testing of
                  JavaScript and CSS.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I realise this is quite a long article, so
                  <a href="#" onclick="Debug.ShowWindow(); return false;"
                    >if you're too eager</a
                  >, just hit the back-tick key under escape. Evaluate 'window',
                  too. Just for fun ;-)
                </p>

                <p>
                  Now! If you adhere to the principle of code/style/content
                  separation by placing all your CSS and JavaScript in external
                  files, this should make your lives easier, it certainly does
                  for me. &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; I hear you ask. Well if,
                  like me, you spend most of your time editing a CSS file,
                  saving it, going to your browser, pressing F5 to refresh (or,
                  to be safe, CTRL+F5), viewing your changes then repeat, then
                  that is fine for most scenarios. But what if you're developing
                  a web application that has lots of dynamic content brought in
                  by ajax? Well usually it means going through the extra work of
                  recalling the ajax method, with potential database hits thrown
                  into the mix. In other words, this can be a real bottleneck as
                  simple CSS changes can take 5-10 seconds per tweak
                </p>

                <p>
                  Well a number of possibilities occurred to me. A nice gui for
                  editing CSS changes by selecting html elements and adjusting
                  the rules would be swell. Something like the way
                  <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">Firebug</a> does. The
                  downside of the Firebug approach is that changes get lost and
                  you end up having to replicate the changes in your original
                  source anyway. Great for playing around with, but anything
                  more is painful.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So I thought that an enhanced version of that would be neat;
                  something that keeps track of your changes and when you're
                  fully happy with it, you can simply export all the changed
                  files. Still, implementing that would be a fearsome task.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Then the obvious hit me in the face: why not just add the
                  ability to <em>just refresh the CSS files themselves</em>?
                  Well happily this approach was very simple to implement by
                  extending my <a href="../js/Debug.js">debug.js</a> class.
                </p>

                <p>
                  So, after a whirlwind few hours of development, the following
                  four functions have been added that make for a nice
                  refreshing-without-refreshing approach to JavaScript and CSS
                  development:
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>List JavaScript files</li>
                  <li>Refresh JavaScript files</li>
                  <li>List CSS files</li>
                  <li>Refresh CSS files</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  I also threw in a quick cookie lister, free of charge
                  naturally.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Anyway, I hope you find those functions useful. Aside from
                  those new functions, the original
                  <a href="../js/Debug.js">Debug.js</a> class was a basic debug
                  message logging system. It contains the usual methods for
                  writing errors, warnings or trace statements to the log itself
                  (which is made visible using the back-tick key - the one under
                  the escape key - go on, give it a try!):
                </p>

                <dl>
                  <dt>Debug.Error(value, [title])</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Creates an error window containing 'value'. Background
                    colour is reddish.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Debug.Warning(value, [title])</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Creates an warning window containing 'value'. Background
                    colour is yellow.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Debug.Info(value, [title])</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Creates an info window containing 'value'. Background colour
                    is green.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Debug.Write(value, [title])</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Creates a debug box containing 'value'. Background colour is
                    pale yellow
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Debug.InspectObject(obj, [title], [class])</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Creates an object browser (tree view of objects contents).
                    Class is the CSS class applied to the entry.
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Debug.Xml(sXml)</dt>
                  <dd>
                    Pass this an xml string to display the xml nicely formatted
                    in a debug window.
                  </dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>Bookmarklet - Debug any page!</h3>

                <p>
                  If ever you want an easy way to inspect any page on the
                  internet, why not try this handy bookmarklet. Just drag it
                  into your favourites and click it whenever you want access to
                  the console:
                </p>

                <a
                  class="bookmarklet"
                  href="javascript:(function(){var s=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='http://rdgreen.dev/js/Debug.js';document.body.appendChild(s);})()"
                  >Debug Page</a
                >
